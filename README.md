# CS255
Module 8

## This is my Project two of my CS255 course, I would just like to thank my professor for being so helpful and understanding this term, I got my AS in CS wooooooo!!!!

### I like markdown!ðŸ”¥

### This was my *Driverpass* project for my CS250 course The driver passed system is made-up of the user the instructor the admin the payment services the DMV and the secretary, there is a UML diagram demonstrating the relationship between these parties. Their are also multiple other graphs in the document.
I also included a presentation that tells what the system should be comprised of. I read the system requirments presented in the requirments outlined by the user. One way that I approach designing software is usually from the requirments set forth by the user and then usually adjust to the requirments and use the resources to make sure requirments are adequetly met.
